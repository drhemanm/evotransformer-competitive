## Key Findings

### What Worked

✅ **Unfreezing top RoBERTa layers** (+3-5%)
- Allows adaptation to physical reasoning domain
- Top 4 layers optimal (6 layers caused instability)

✅ **Data augmentation** (+2-3%)
- Solution swapping forces careful reading
- 4x training data improved generalization

✅ **Contrastive learning** (+1-2%)
- Pushes correct solutions closer in embedding space
- Improved representation quality

✅ **RoBERTa-base over BERT** (+3-4%)
- Better pretraining (10x longer, better data)
- Stronger starting point

### What Didn't Work

❌ **Memory token** - Minimal impact with RoBERTa
❌ **Higher dropout (0.3)** - Caused training instability
❌ **Excessive unfreezing (6+ layers)** - Overfitting

## Statistical Significance

**Validation set:** 1,838 examples

At 70.35% accuracy:
- Correct: 1,293 examples
- Standard error: ±1.07%
- 95% CI: [68.2%, 72.5%]

**vs Original (63.06%):**
- Difference: 7.29%
- p < 0.001 (highly significant)
